# Simple Parallax Effect via CC
This was a tutorial product from CC using SASS to create a parallax effect. However, it was not <a href="https://github.com/daryldelrosario/cc-parallax-test/releases/tag/v.0.1.0">working.</a> Checked out some videos on other parallax effects and was able to fix it. Current live demo shows fixed version 0.1.1.
